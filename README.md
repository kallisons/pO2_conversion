## pO2 Conversion

1) Oxygen concentration is converted to percent oxygen saturation using the equations from Garcia and Gordon (1992). 
2) The percent oxygen saturation is divided by 0.21 (the fractional atmospheric concentration of oxygen) to get pO2 in atmospheres (atm).
3) pO2 is then corrected for the hydrostatic pressure at depth (Enns et al., 1965). 
4) The units for pO2 are converted to kilopascals (kPa), the SI Units for pressure.
